I stream at [twitch.tv/arnirat](twitch.tv/arnirat) on the following days. Format is subject to change.

Times are North America Central Time (UTC-5).

* **Monday, 6:00pm**
  - Retro day: 90s PC games, 6th-gen consoles and older
* **Wednesday, 6:00pm**
  - Flex day: oddities, on-camera activities
* **Friday, 6:00pm**
  - Modern day: more recent indie games, or the occasional big-name title.
* **Sunday, 3:00pm _(optional)_**
  - Chill day: coding, art, or puzzle/atmosphere games.

**Note:** I have Non-24 sleep disorder which sometimes necessitates shifting stream schedules or taking time off. Check Discord announcements for schedule updates.

I stream at [twitch.tv/arnirat](twitch.tv/arnirat) on the following days. Format is subject to change.

Times are North America Central Time (UTC-5).

* **Monday, 6:00pm**
  - Retro games - for my purposes, anything ~20+ years old.
* **Wednesday, 6:00pm**
  - Bit of a flex day, I'll play particularly odd games or even do on-camera activities sometimes.
* **Friday, 6:00pm**
  - More modern indie games, or the occasional big-name title.
* **Sunday, 3:00pm _(optional)_**
  - Chill stream with coding, art, or puzzle/atmosphere games.

"THIS HAS TO STOP," ends a Bluesky post from author Stephen King. What has to stop, exactly, I couldn't tell you. Since I started writing this entry I've already lost track of which specific outrageous thing the US government has done in the less than two weeks since inauguration.

Every now and then I make the mistake of visiting Bluesky on a client where I'm not already logged in, and my judicious blocks and filters aren't in place. The front page will be a rotating cast of once-celebrities like Mr. King, pundits like Jamelle Bouie, politicians like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, populist-cosplaying billionaires like Mark Cuban, and a lot of "Resist" authors and podcasters you'd have no reason to have ever heard of outside of Bluesky. And Patton Oswalt.

Nearly every post from this Greek chorus will be some variant of "THIS HAS TO STOP," where "THIS" is one of the endless things that the current US administration has been promising to do - not surreptitiously, but published openly, with chapters and bullet points and a giant fucking neon sign pointed at it for the last decade. And our only response is "What they're doing is criminal! Someone should put a stop to this! Call your congressperson and tell them how angry you are!"

It's utterly baffling to think that people have been alive in the US for the past ten years and still think that there is any institution left that will prevent any of these awful things from happening - to think that any of these so-called pundits could be expected to have the dimmest awareness of the absorption of the Supreme Court and nearly every media outlet of consequence by an oligarchy whose evil defies description, and *still think* there is someone in this system who is prepared to save us. The only thing any of those people are prepared to do is post "THIS HAS TO STOP" on Bluesky.

It's a singularly depressing and infuriating thing to see, because it once again reveals key points about our nation, if not our species, and why we keep ending up here. One, we will only ever vote for our leaders based on our perceived economic interests. Two, we will not ever be interested in how anything in the world works outside of our immediate surroundings. Three, we have the collective memory of goldfish.

Accuse me all you like of living in an echo chamber where I can tailor all current events out of my Bluesky timeline, but I cannot accept that hand-wringing over every single step of society's collapse is in any way better than simply coming to terms with the consequences. And I trust my own powers of observation enough to know what's coming.

We will have nothing resembling a federal government. All orders will come from a tiny cabal and rubber stamped by the high court.

Much of the environment as we know it will be gone. FEMA will be gone.

Vaccines will be gone. Trans health care for children *and* adults will be gone. A large chunk of healthcare in general will be gone, for those who can still afford it.

Obergefell, gone. Civil Rights Act, gone. Abortion, gone. Whatever they deem "porn," gone.

Privacy, consumed by Google and Amazon. Art, consumed by AI. What's left of the internet, consumed by the Department of Truth.

Ukraine, gone.

Elections, gone.

That's the tip of the iceberg. None of us know how much worse things will get, or for how long.

Is it possible not all of these things will happen? I guess. I only maintain that it's unhealthy to imagine they won't. I want to commiserate with the experience of realizing that none of the safeguards you thought were inherent to the American experience are real, nor have they ever been real. That all that we really have is us. And if you haven't realized that yet, you probably should. Indignance will not keep you alive.

We need to accept that many of us are not going to live long enough to see things get better, if they get better at all. We need networking, not outrage. We need understanding that we are gaming the system just enough to survive, and getting resources where they need to be.

If we're ever to move forward again, "THIS HAS TO STOP" has to stop.

It was a muggy June, and I was struggling. I realized that all the things I wanted to do and write were running circles in my head instead of actually getting done, so I resolved to do something that I had never been comfortable with, and would take a great physical and emotional toll: I went on a two-week vacation.

Okay, that's a little dramatic. I had taken breaks from my job for week-ish-long stretches before, and I normally found myself at the trailing end of them eager to get back to my loose routines, my projects, my bed, my _stuff_. But those times were different; I was younger, enjoying the more reasonable rent of the front half of the 2010s, and having something of a flesh-and-blood social circle. All in all I had a fair amount to look forward to coming _back_ to. New scenery was scary. Schedules were scary.

This year, without going into too much detail, has not been kind to me on the well-being front. Vague health anomalies were cutting into my already-fraught sleep schedule. Work was grinding me down with minutae. The thrill of home ownership was being rapidly smothered by crabgrass. Voluntarily taking a fortnight to completely dissociate was a much easier trigger to pull this time around.

I had some simple goals for this trip: go into the woods, take pictures, read books. No thinking about work or streaming or programming at all. Apart from that I had no real plan other than where I would be staying: three nights in Wausau, Wisconsin, followed by three nights in St. Paul, Minnesota. From there I could figure out where to wander each day.

And wander I did. Each day went roughly like this: I'd wake up and drive ~2 hours to a state park that looked interesting, walk around for 1-2 hours taking pictures and sweating a lot, then drive back to the hotel, shower, and go through my reading list. No coding, no video games, and very little internet consumption (thanks largely to flaky hotel wifi). In fact, being quite sedentary, I was surprised at how much I _looked forward_ to going headlong into those short hikes each day, sometimes walking so far downhill that I'd panic over whether I'd make it back up (spoiler: I did).

Prior to the trip, in the throes of my angst, I imagined myself slowly disappearing into the landscape like Homer Simpson backing into a bush, until I'd emptied my body and soul to accept my place in the universe, a speck on a planet of roughly 8 billion specks all bouncing off each other like very shouty electrons. As it turned out, I didn't have time for that much rumination; wrangling camera knobs kept most of my attention, with the rest directed at keeping the sunscreen from rolling down with sweat into my eyes.

I took what felt like a lot of pictures but not enough. One problem, I learned, was that I wanted to keep moving in order to see more.

When I got back home late Sunday evening, I had just enough energy left to shower—after flushing my pipes from a water main break that had apparently occurred on my street while I was gone—before crashing. I wouldn't fully feel like I was back to normal until Wednesday. That was when I was hit with a sense of depression and dread. I assumed this was common—all vacations must end, after all—but I knew specifically what I was afraid of: that all the good that came from this break was slipping away from me. Like it never happened.

I came to the awful realization that my "normal" meant reassuming most of the same anxieties that I'd left behind when embarking on my trip. In gaining back my routine, I'd lost my grip on something precious. And it dawned on me that for so long my comfort zone has been really uncomfortable.

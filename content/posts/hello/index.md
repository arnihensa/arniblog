Welcome to my new blog!

I decided to make this website as a place for any long-form thoughts that wouldn't fit elsewhere. I haven't put a terribly large amount of thought into its design, but it's given me the chance to mess around with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) which is pretty neat.

I thought about registering a custom domain for this blog - and I may in the future - but I couldn't think of anything terribly clever, and domain renewal seems to be getting more expensive, so I decided to keep it nice and simple for now.

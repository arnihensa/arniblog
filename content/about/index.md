Hi! I'm Arni. Professionally, I'm a software developer, currently living near Chicago. I also do a stream where I play old and/or weird video games, and try to be funny sometimes.

This blog is quite new, and it's hard to say what will go here, but I intend to use it mainly to write about my current projects, and whatever else is on my mind.

(Expect this page to change in the near future!)

Hi! I'm Arni, and I'm a software developer by trade. In 2022, I started streaming on Twitch as a VTuber because it looked like fun. Not only has it been fun, it's been a tremendous creative outlet, the start of many new friendships, and the motivation for some personal software projects which I'll be pursuing in the near future.

I cut my gaming teeth on the Atari 2600 (and later the 800XL). Some of my favorite gaming memories are from mid-to-late-90s PC games, so I like to stream those games along with anything odd enough to talk about.

I made this website to [curate](https://www.merriam-webster.com/grammar/can-you-curate-anything) - in the sense of finding long-term storage space for things other than our increasingly volatile social media - my thoughts and exploits in this streaming adventure. Anything that doesn't fit on Bluesky or Discord is likely to go here.

I have no formal training in art or graphic design - as is probably obvious by this website. However, in 2023 I started modeling and rigging my own 3D VTuber model, and I'm getting more confident in sharing my modeling and drawing work, so you may see that here as well.

Thanks for reading!
